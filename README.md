# Aire Logic Tech Test - Tom Kelly

To run this program, simply open the console app "AireLogicConsoleApp.exe" under the "Console App" folder, or run it from Visual Studio using the solution file in "Source Code."

I've added options to get the lyric count of a single artist or compare two artists.

Really wish I had more time on this, I had originally planned to make a web application and complete some more of the extra tasks, but unfortunately I ran out of time tonight.

Thank you for the opportunity and I'd love to hear any feedback.
